Student Data Record System
This is a program that allows users to store, retrieve, and modify data for students. It is written in C++ and uses a file to store the data.

# Features

- Search for a student by ID or name
- Modify an existing student record
- Delete a student record
- View all student records

# Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g. g++, clang++)
- Make (optional, but recommended for building the program)

# Building and Running <br><br>
To build the program, navigate to the project directory and run make. This will create an executable file called student_records.

To run the program, simply execute the student_records file.

# File Structure <br><br>
The program uses a file called student_records.txt to store the data. This file should be located in the same directory as the program.
